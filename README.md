My name is Victoria Smityukh, I am 30 years old. I live in the city of Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine. 

I have a BA (бакалавр) або ж MA (магістр) degree in Psychology Studies. As well as I have an additional education in the PC Operations (Accountant) field of study. 

One and a half years ago, I resigned from my job as a government official and decided to change my professional path radically and try myself out in IT field. Since I am always learning new things, for me this was an opportunity to do what really gets my interest and attention, rather than a difficult challenge. 

To begin with, my goal was to work as a web designer. Meanwhile I was actively looking for courses. During the searching process, I was offered training with a mentor. It included the entire prompt complex of knowledge, starting from the basics of programming and ending with full-stack development. The main focus in learning was put on web design. 

At the end of the course I was given a practical lesson that included writing code in HTML5 and CSS3, creating a theme in Wordpress and implementing it in this CMS. Which I have successfully done. In the process of completing the task, I was very interested and at that moment I realized that front-end development is the direction in which I will move forward. After that, I continued my studies on my own. Finally, I mastered JavaScript (JS)  and did many practical tasks. Currently I am ready to be useful in this field.

It is important for me to have the opportunity to grow and develop. There are many planned skills. A progressive company that provides employees with opportunities for professional growth would be an ideal option for me.

I value support and kindness in all areas of my life. It is crucial for me to be not only in a team of professionals, but also people who I can rely on. I respect personal boundaries, the opinion of others. I appreciate fair criticism and a good mood.

As psychologists say, "we all come from childhood." I was involved in the field of IT from the age of 4, I made a toy computer and worked with a great concentration. At the age of 17, I bought my first laptop with the first saved salary. At 19, I reinstalled Windows for the first time. Since I was 23 years old, I have been actively working and helping students with their research papers, I run several business pages in social networks. I am engaged in the design of advertising banners and marketing as well.

IT is the field to which I unconsciously went all my conscious life. Now I know, I can and I want to be useful. I will be happy to cooperate.
Thank you.
